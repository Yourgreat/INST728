 <h2>Hobby</h2>
 <p> Since we are teleworking due to the pandemic, I have been enjoying gardening in my yard. <br>
 
  <h3>List of vegetables I have grown</h3> 
   <ul>
      <li>peppers</li>
      <li>tomatoes</li>
      <li>lettuce</li>
      <li>strawberries</li>
      <li>bean sprouts</li>   
         </ul>  
        
I tried many ways to grow bean sprouts after watching YouTube videos.
I learned that using  <u><strong>  jars </strong> </u> is the best method to grow bean sprouts. <br>

 <h2> Favorite food</h2>
 <p>I like to eat fruit and vegetables more than eating meat. 
 Bibimbop is one of my favorite dishes because it contains a lot of vegetables. <br>

I also like to have a cup of coffee in the late morning because if I drink coffee in the late afternoon, 
I would have a hard time to fall a sleep. </p>
