 <h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p> My name is Juli Han. I am half way through the MLIS program. I work at the Library of Congress, in the Asian Division.<br>
  I am a processing technician for their Korean collection. I have been working at the Library since 2015.

 <h2>Hobby</h2>
 <p> Since we are teleworking due to the pandemic, I have been enjoying gardening in my yard. <br>

 I have grown peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, strawberries and bean sprouts. <br>
 I tried many ways to grow bean sprouts after watching youtube videos. I learned that using jars is the best method to grow bean sprouts. <br>
<h2>Favorite food</h2>
I like to eat fruit and vegetables more than eating meat.<br>
 Bibimbop is one of my favorite dishes because it contains a lot of vegetables. <br>

I also like to have a cup of coffee in the late morning because if I drink coffee in the late afternoon, I would have a hard time to fall a sleep.<br>
