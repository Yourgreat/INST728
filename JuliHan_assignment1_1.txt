My name is Juli Han. I am half way through the MLIS programm.
I work at the Library of Congress, in the Asian Division. 
I am processing technician for their Korean collection.

I have been working at the library since 2015.
Since we are teleworking due to the pandemic, I have been enjoying gardening in my yard. 
I have grown peppers, tomatoes, lettuce, strawberries and bean sprouts. 
I tried many ways to grow bean sprouts after watching YouTube videos. 
I learned that using jars is the best method to grow bean sprouts. 

I like to eat fruits and  vegetables more than eating meat. 
Bibimbop is one of my favorite food because it contains a lot of vegetables. 
I also like to have a cup of coffee in the late morning 
becasuse if I drink coffee in the late afternoon, I would have a hard time to fall a sleep.

I will go back to work starting next week, July 20. 
I am little excited to go back to work. 

I hope this pandemic will end we can all go back to normal.
